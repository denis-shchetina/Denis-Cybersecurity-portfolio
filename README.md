A short intro:
I am an intelligence-driven cybersecurity analyst. I transitioned into the cyber community in 2022 from the intelligence community while I was serving in the United States Air Force at Fort Meade, Maryland. Prior to being assigned to a Cyberspace Operations Squadon, I served in an intelligence squadron where I identified and performed target development on high-value military targets employing advanced weapon systems across multiple areas of operations. I conducted language translation, performed quality control of translations and led an analysis and reporting team and a target development team that tracked and reported on weapon system deployments and activities, TTPs, and personnel rotations. Prior to being in the intelligence community, i was an F-15 fighter avionics technician, which was my first job when i joined the Air Force in 2007.

I became interested in cybersecurity when i transferred to a cyber operations squadron in late 2022. I was motivated by the Ukraine war and wanted a more active role in the fight against our enemy, a target that i have hunted while i was doing tradtional intelligence work.  When i transferred to the cyberspace operations squadon, i was amazed by our cyber operations against the enemy and wanted to learn more on how the magic worked. I helped CNMF disrupt enemy supply chains, guided cyber operators through enemy networks, performed technical language translations which produced network intelignece and identified vulnerabilities which enabled further cyber operations. While doing all of these things, i realized i knew very little and i asked to receive additional cyber training. My unit granted me SANS Training in 2023 and i fell in love with this cyber line of work.
